Using python and xpath to provide a list of slugs for analysis

I'm using the google2pandas library here to integrate with the Google Analytics API 

You need to set up your Google Analytics credentials to use this

There are good instructions on how to get the library and authenticated to use it on the google2pandas github page https://github.com/panalysis/Google2Pandas
