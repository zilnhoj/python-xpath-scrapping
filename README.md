# python-xpath-scrapping
Using python and xpath to provide a list of slugs for analysis

I'm using the google2pandas library here to integrate with the Google Analytics API 

You need to set up your Google Analytics credentials to use this

There are good instructions on how to get the library and get authenticated to use it on the google2pandas github page https://github.com/panalysis/Google2Pandas

Set the variable called 'url' with the URL of the page you want to scrape the data from

Get the XPath expression for the data you want to scrape from the page

Set the varible 'listofslugs' with the XPath expression for all the slugs on the page

Change the start and end dates to the dates you want to report on
